#Basic if-else questions:
#Write a python program that checks if a number is positive/negative/zero.

#Write a program that checks wheather a given number is even/odd.

      print(b,":value is even")
elif b%1==0:

# Write a program that asks the user to enter marks and assigns grades as follows:

# Write a Python program that takes a temperature input in Celsius and categorizes it as:
